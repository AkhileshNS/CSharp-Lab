# Design a private assembly in C# that prints a console message and as well as a Message Box Using Windows forms (System.Windows.Forms). Use the assembly in both a c sharp program and a Visual basic Program.

P.S A video form of these steps can be found on https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oBz9R1tGU0BSXMYOh35ZPOlvBsUl-q4k

- Select File -> New -> Project. Choose Visual C# -> ClassLibrary (.NET Framework). Accept the default name and press Ok

- Add the following code in Class1.cs

  ````c#
  using System;
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  using System.Linq;
  using System.Text;
  using System.Threading.Tasks;
  
  namespace ClassLibrary1
  {
      public class Class1
      {
          public void print()
          {
              Console.WriteLine("Printing Logs...");
          }
      }
  }
  ````

- In the Solution Explorer (on the right side), right click on References -> Add Reference. In Assemblies, check 'System.Drawing' and 'System.Windows.Forms' and click Ok

- Now right click on  ClassLibrary1 (or whatever the name of your project is) in the Solution Explorer and go to Add -> Windows Form...

- Then on the top bar, go to Build -> Build Solution.

  If you see "Build: 1 succeeded" in the output. move on to the next step

- Create a new project under Visual C# -> Console Application (.NET Framework), accept the default name and click OK.
  Also add references to System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing as before but in the references menu, also click on browse and go to _repos/Class1Library/ClassLibrary1/bin/debug/Class1Library.dll_. Add this as well

- In Program.cs add the following code:

  ````c#
  using System;
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  using System.Linq;
  using System.Text;
  using System.Threading.Tasks;
  using System.Windows.Forms;
  using ClassLibrary1;
  
  namespace ConsoleApp1
  {
      class Program
      {
          [STAThread]
          static void Main(string[] args)
          {
              Application.Run(new Form1());
  
              Class1 cl = new Class1();
              cl.print();
  
              Console.ReadLine();
          }
      }
  }
  ````

  and click 'Start' at the top. 

- Create a new project under Visual Basic -> Console Application (.NET Framework), accept the default name and click OK.

- Also add references to System.Windows.Forms and System.Drawing as before but in the references menu, also click on browse and go to _repos/Class1Library/ClassLibrary1/bin/debug/Class1Library.dll_. Add this as well

- In Module1.vb add the following code

  ````visual basic
  Imports ClassLibrary1
  
  Module Module1
  
      Sub Main()
  
          Dim form As New Form1()
          form.Show()
  
          Dim cl As New Class1()
          cl.print()
  
          Console.ReadLine()
  
      End Sub
  
  End Module
  ````

  and click 'Start' at the top
